### Updating Content (News, Publications and People)
The iSING Lab homepage separates rendering logic from data. The data is stored in JSON files in the `data` directory. The rendering is done in the `index.html` file. 

To update the content, simply make changes to the data files (`data-news.json`, `data-publications.json` or `data-people.json`) to add new entries on iSING Lab homepage.

As a safety measure, all changes to the data files should be done on a separate branch. Please fork your own branch and send a pull request to the `master` branch.
